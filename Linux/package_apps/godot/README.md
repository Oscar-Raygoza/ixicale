# Installing GODOT ENGINE

## Ubuntu 18.04!

Hey! Here you can try to test GODOT devs to create games with python/C#

First you need its download the godot package *[here](https://godotengine.org/download/linux "official site to download Godot")* or *[here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/Godot_Engine/ "steam site, also you can download godot!")*

After download godot's package, unzip and move the godot's file where you prefer... ([you can create a link to access and open the application]( "Also into this repo!"))
