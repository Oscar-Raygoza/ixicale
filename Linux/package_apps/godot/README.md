# Installing GODOT ENGINE

## Ubuntu 18.04!

    Portable envoirement!

Hey! Here you can try to test GODOT devs to create games with python or C#

1. First you need its download the godot package into *[gotod's Official site](https://godotengine.org/download/linux "Official site to download Godot for linux!")* or into *[steam site!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/Godot_Engine/ "Steam site, also you can download godot!")*

2. Unzip and move the godot's file where you prefer... *([you can create a link to access and open the application](https://github.com/ixicale/SteampunkFactory-MySettings/blob/master/Linux/settings/links/README.md "Also into this repo!"))*

3. Use Godot!

Simple and faster, i hope it was usefully!

See you next round! ~
